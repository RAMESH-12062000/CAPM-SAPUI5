# SYNOPSIS

    *cds build* [<project>] [<options>]

    Builds all modules in the current project by compiling contained CDS
    sources.
    The modules are folders in the project root directory. All well known
    modules (db, srv, app) or those configured by build tasks defined in
    *package.json* or *.cdsrc.json* are built.

# OPTIONS

     *-4 | --for* hana | java | nodejs | mtx | mtx-sidecar | mtx-extension
        Name of the build task that is applied to the source folder, either
        explicitly configured in the build task list or generated out of the
        project setup
        For example, the 'hana' build task will create SAP HANA artefacts.
        The module folder can be defined using option '--src', a default is used
        otherwise.

    *-s | --src* <folder>
        The module folder to build using the build task defined by option
        '--for'.
        This option is only supported when building an individual module of the
        project.
        The folder is resolved based on '<project>/<cds.env.build.target>'.
        A default is used based on the type of the build task, for example, the
        folder 'db' is used for a
        *hana* build task, 'srv' for *nodejs* or *java* build task.

    *-o | --dest* <folder>
        Output folder of the build task. The type of build task is defined by
        option '--for'.
        The folder is resolved based on '<project>/<cds.env.build.target>'.
        Default - folder defined by option '--src'.
        Note: <cds.env.build.target> can be configured in *.cdsrc.json* or
        *package.json*.
        For Node.js projects the folder 'gen' is used by default. The output is
        written to '<project>/gen/*<dest>*/*'.
        For Java projects '.' is used by default. The output is written to
        '<project>/*<dest>*/*'.

    *--opts* <build task specific options>
        Add a comma-separated list of build task specific options in the format
        <opt1>=[value1,value2],<opt2>=value.
        For example, --opts model=[db,srv,schema.cds] loads and compiles the CDS
        model based on the given sources.

    *--profile* <profile,...>
        Loads the configuration data for the specified profile(s) and executes
        'cds build' based on this profile settings.
        E.g. you may want to create the HANA deployment artefacts only if the
        *production* profile is set.
        The *development* profile is used by default.

    *--production*
        Shortcut for '--profile production'

    *--log-level* <debug | info | warn | error>
        Choose which level of cds build messages to log, default is *warn*.

    *-in | --project* [<project>]
        Runs 'cds build' for the specified project, default is current working
        directory.
        
    *--no-clean* (beta)
        Skips cleaning the build output folder before running the actual build
        operation. Clients need to clean the output folder upfront to ensure
        consistent build results.

    *--ws-pack* (beta)
        Enable tarball based packaging of npm workspace dependencies - typically defined for
        Node.js mono or multi-repo setups.
        For each workspace dependency of your project using '*' as version identifier,
        a tarball will be created in folder 'gen/srv'. Dependencies in package.json
        will be adapted to point to the correct tarball file URL.
        Contents is packaged based on the rules of the 'npm pack' command.

    *--ws* (beta)
        Npm workspaces are typically used in mono or multi-repo setups whereas each workspace
        folder represents a microservice CAP project with subfolders _db_, _srv_, _app_.
        With the *ws* option the model scope used in executed build tasks is calculated based on
        all workspaces. This also applies to the feature toggles. Feature toggles defined cross workspace 
        are merged. The output is created in the _mtx/sidecar_ for multitenant applications
        or in the 'srv' folder for node.js apps if no sidecar exists.
        HANA native content distributed across the workspaces is copied into the top-level 'db'
        folder of the project. This 'db' folder represents the single database shared by all workspaces.
        *Note:* Make sure to use consistent package versions in your workspace dependencies in order
        to avoid compilation errors caused by duplicate model definitions.

   *cds* build --for hana
   *cds* build --for java --src service1
   *cds* build --for java --dest ../srv/target --opts model=[db/model,srv,schema]
